## Project

- Guidelines: the goal of this project is to allow you make a connection
between course topics and real world. The course project is to push you get immersed in real life and is very important for us.

- Topics I suggested are as follows:

- 1. We talked about [Chinaâ€™s Foreign Trade: Perspectives From the Past 150 Years](https://chinawto.netlify.app/pdf/ChinaTrade150ys_Keller_Li_Shiue.pdf); based on the paper and other information you could get, replicate a paper [The United States in a New Global Economy? A Century's Perspective](https://chinawto.netlify.app/pdf/USinaNewGlobalEconomy.pdf) for a China's version.

- 2. The impart of [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) on the world trade and the trade of China. In the west, it is considered as [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan).

- 3. The impact of Russia Ukraine war on the world trade and the trade of China.
